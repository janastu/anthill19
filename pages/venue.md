Anterras of Devarayanadurga and Iruway farm at its foothills - about 75 KM NW of Bangalore and 15KM East of Tumkur, India.
Devarayanadurga is a living fort town from the Vijayanagara Empire period and is picturesque where these hills become a part of the 360 degree hills range, the valley now has 4 villages and lots of forest and trekking areas with majestic rocks.

There is a Yatri Nivas - a travellers lodge and other smaller "guest houses" built by the devotees of the temple on the hill. Anterras is agricultural stepped terraces that is owned and used by a buffalo herder for grazing, where we pitch our tents.

We will set up a kitchen in this area too.

Some of the Anthillhacks sessions and activities will be at the iruWay farm at the west side foothills of Devarayanadurga. This is reachable by a 30 min trek from the hill or a 4 km ride by road.
