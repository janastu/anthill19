Accommodation

There are a few rooms, a number of tents and sleep floors at iruway (Janastu basecamp). You are welcome to pitch your own tent. <em>Please bring warm clothes for the evenings</em>. There are also few rooms in the villages nearby, a few at [Yatri Nivas](https://goo.gl/maps/VJvSiWjn9PnxGzEP7) and guest houses atop of Deverayanadurga Hills 
<!-- and there are now a couple of lodges that have come up: [Jenu Gundu](https://jenugundujungletrail.com) and [Nomads Camp](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g858478-d23342353-Reviews-The_Nomad_s_Camps_Devarayanadurga-Tumkur_Tumkur_District_Karnataka.html). -->
